Changes:
-New server tick system(default being 30, max 1000).
-New max afk time setting for servers.
-New map and game mode: Free for All.
-Default BR Map slightly tweaked
-Server script updated to be easier for custom scripting. Now you can make a new file called "custom.js", place it in the same folder as the server scripts and add custom scripts to your server on it! The server by default will respond to 4 main functions called on_start(runs when the server starts), on_tick(runs on every server tick), on_message(runs every time the server receives any message, receiving "msg" and "connection" as input), on_close(runs whenever a connection closes, receives "connection" and "message" as parameter, the later being useful for error detection), but you can write code outside those aswell.
-Both Default map and the free for all contain coconuts in the ground that restore health.
-New Melee weapon: Sword.
-New script files to run the server using purely node.js
-New indication to where the buildings are going to spawn when using the building tool.
-Added TTS Chat option.
-The player and event(in custom map) limit per server has been raised from 100 to 1000(Thanks to all performance optimizations on both client and server).
-New animations and sound effects added.
-New UI that shows kills, name and ID(default key: TAB).
-Client now shows how fast you're downloading a custom map.
-Now if the player isn't running, they won't make footstep noises anymore.
-Minimap now displays a red dot indicating player position on the map.
-Removed the patreon button.
-New auto updater added to the main menu.
-Player also changes skin randomly when they join a server.
-When a player dies, the screen now turns grey for them and there will blood where they were to indicate someone died in that spot. The server now also announces when a player dies and, depending on game mode, it will announce the amount of players left(both in chat).
-Added emojis to chat
-Added new /w and /whisper chat commands for sending a private message to a player in game.
-Removed upload limits for throttling the upload
-Players now drop the items they were carrying when they die.

Optimizations:
-The game's zip file is now 25% smaller.
-Messages are better encrypted and encryption/decryption should be 10% faster aswell.
-Many server functions are no longer anonymous, being now properly cached. This should nearly double their performance.
-Several micro optimizations for the client.
-Amount of messages sent between client and server has been reduced, saving up data and server processing.

Fixes:
-Fixed minor collision problems on default map.
-Fixed some problems with the bots A.I.
-Fixed Portals on the default map not respawning on match reset.
-Fixed instances where if the player reached exactly 0 HP, they would get knockout status, not allowing the HP to be recovered and making them an eternal ghost.
-Fixed bug where trying to damage an enemy behind a broken wall block would make the client freeze.
-Fixed visual bug where using teleports would "reset" MP and HP bars.
-Fixed bug where sometimes a player would be desynchronized to other people.
-Fixed small typo in visual interface for the server script.
-Fixed issues with downloading custom maps.
-Fixed issue where you would drop the chest if pressed the drop key while chat is open.
-Fixed server allowing a player to be teleport to a NaN position, which would result in a blackscreen
-Fixed issues with sending gold to the player that got a kill in certain occasions
-Fixed issues related to players not showing up, or names randomly showing up even without a player being there. Hopefully a definitive fix for this issue.
