>You can create a copy of an event by calling the createObject() function in your server, and setting the "extra" parameter as "tocopy" and the following parameter as the ID of the event to be copied. The event created will be a carbon copy of the original, with exception of the serverID. >For singleplayer, call $copyEvent(id_to_copy,id_of_current_event)
